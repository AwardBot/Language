<h1>How can you help translate?</h1>
<br>
When you translate the JS file in the "Languages" folder to the language you desire and submit a Pull Request, we will review it and if it's suitable, we will add it to the bot. If it's approved, we will contact you and present you with the translator role on our Discord server.
